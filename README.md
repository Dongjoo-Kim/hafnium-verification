# Hafnium Verification

Welcome to the Hafnium verification project. Hafnium is an open source project
to build a secure hypervisor that allows system designers to achieve
confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data with fine-grained security
domains. One of the top priorities of Project Oak is to provide higher assurance
of Hafnium's security using formal verification. 

There are currently two projects going on in this repo.

- Formal verification: https://github.com/project-oak/hafnium-verification/tree/hfo2/coq-verification
- Rewriting in Rust: https://github.com/project-oak/hafnium-verification/tree/hfo2/hfo2
